# PKGBUILDs

An assorted collection of [PKGBUILDs][1] for [Arch Linux][2].

This repository is primarily for personal use. I don't (yet) maintain any
PKGBUILDs for serious public consumption, so unless you find my patches
interesting, you're better off using the ones that have been shared on the
[AUR][3].
